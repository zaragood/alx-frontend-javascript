# 0x01-ES6_promise

## Description
This project is a simple demonstration of using ES6 promises in JavaScript. It covers the basics of creating, consuming, and chaining promises to handle asynchronous operations.

## Features
- Creating a Promise
- Resolving a Promise
- Rejecting a Promise
- Chaining Promises
- Handling Errors with Promises

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x01-ES6_promise.git
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd 0x01-ES6_promise
```
2. Open the `index.js` file in your preferred text editor.
3. Explore the examples provided in the file to understand how promises work.
4. Run the script using Node.js:
```bash
node index.js
```

## Examples
### Creating a Promise
```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved successfully!");
    // reject(new Error("Something went wrong!"));
  }, 2000);
});
```

### Using Promises
```javascript
myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Promise resolved:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Promise rejected:", error);
  });
```
